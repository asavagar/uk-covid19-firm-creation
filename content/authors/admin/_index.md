My formal name is Ioannis and I am Postodoctoral Research Associate at the University of Kent. I work on a project, entitled ["Business Creation in the UK"]({{< ref "/research/BusinessCreationUK/_index.md" >}}), in collaboration with [Alfred Duncan](https://www.alfredduncan.co.uk/), [Miguel León-Ledesma](https://sites.google.com/site/miguelleonledesmaspernonalsite) and [Anthony Savagar](https://www.asavagar.com/home). I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics, supervised by [Amanda Gosling]( https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/staff/profiles/amanda-gosling.html) and [Olena Nizalova]( https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/people/455/nizalova-olena). Also, I am a network research fellow of the GLO, where I participated in the [VirtYS program](https://glabor.org/platform/virtual-young-scholars-glo-virtys/) of [2019/20](https://glabor.org/glo-virtual-young-scholars-program-glo-virtys-announcement-of-the-2019-20-glo-virtys-cohort/).
