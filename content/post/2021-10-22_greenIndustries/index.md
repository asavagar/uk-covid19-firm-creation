COP26 climate conference in Glasgow soon, we measure firm creation in sectors with "green jobs". 


<!--more-->

In almost a week, the UK will host the [26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26)](https://ukcop26.org/) in Glasgow. This motivates the question to see how many firms are still active in sectors where "green jobs" exist.

## Which are the "green jobs" sector?
[ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/thechallengesofdefiningagreenjob) acknowledges how difficult it is to define a "green job". Our work uses the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting definition as ONS. This includes 17 relevant activities. However, it is challenging to match all 17 activities to [UK's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html).

The following table outlines our match between the "green activities" and SIC codes. `NA` denotes a not available match.
