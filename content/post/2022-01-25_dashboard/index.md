The beta version of our interactive data visualisation dashboard app launches today!
<!--more-->

Our Team is launching today an **interactive dashboard visualisation app** accessible from the menu bar of our website. 

## Sections

The app hosts 3 main sections:
1. **Aggregate Analysis**: daily registrations by region and sector. Explore the distribution by sector using our interactive treemap.
2. **Sectoral Analysis**: daily registrations in multiple 1-digit ("Sections") and 3-digits ("Groups") SIC codes. Make comparisons across different groups *within* the same sectors or *across* different sectors.
3. **Regional Analysis**: daily registrations *within* one "Group" across the different countries in the UK.

## Export-the-data feature
Our dashboard app allows the user to export the data they observe in the Aggregate Analysis tab into `.csv` format. Future updates will include this feature to every tab.

## Code

## Access the app
