## Aggregate Analysis
### Daily 
The charts below show the daily company incorporations in the UK since January 2020. The lockdown periods correspond to our key dates [timeline](https://uk-firm-dynamics.netlify.app/reports/#timeline).

{{< chart data="dailyagg" >}}

- Business creation increased 8.93% from December 2020 to January 2021. 
- 19,512 additional companies were registered in January 2021 relative to January 2019. 
- Business creation increased 13.46% between January 2020 and January 2021.
- The median daily registrations during lockdown-III is 7.7% lower than during lockdown-I and 21% lower than during lockdown-II.  


### Relative  

Company registrations persistently exceed their 2019 levels. Extensive business activity is observed during the first 2 weeks of January 2021. This might be a persistent trend originating from the last week of December 2020 (see EU-UK TCA outliers). Week 3 onwards, companies registration ratio narrows the gap of 2021/2019 against 2020/2019 over the same weeks. We note the calculations for week 5 2021 contain only two days.

### SIC Sections
The graph illustrates company registrations in January 2021, January 2020 and January 2019 by industrial sector. We use 2-digit SIC levels (ONS "divisions") and group into broader sectors (ONS "sections"). We use the [ONS classification](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html). We present a selection of notable sectors.
