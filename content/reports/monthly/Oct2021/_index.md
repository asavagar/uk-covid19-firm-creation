## In a nutshell

We analyse Companies House ["basic company data"](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) up to the September 30th, 2021. We note a slowdown in company registration relative to September 2021. However, firm creation among active firms remains stronger than the same month in 2019.

### SIC Sections
The graph illustrates company registrations in September 2021 relative to 2019 by industrial sector. It compares the percentage change in 2021 relative to 2019 for each week of the year. We use 4-digit SIC levels (ONS "Classes") and group them into broader sectors (ONS "Sections"). We use the [ONS classification](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html). We show a selection of sectors that present notable changes.
