We use 4-digit SIC levels (ONS "Classes") and group them into broader sectors (ONS "Sections"). We use the [ONS classification](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html). We show a selection of sectors that present notable changes.
