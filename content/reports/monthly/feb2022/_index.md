### SIC Sections
The graph illustrates company registrations in January 2022 relative to 2019 by industrial sector. It compares the percentage change in 2021 relative to 2019 for each week of the year. We use 4-digit SIC levels (ONS "Classes") and group them into broader sectors (ONS "Sections"). We use the [ONS classification](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html). We show a selection of sectors that present notable changes.
